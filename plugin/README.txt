Helping you get more done, more easily.

== Description ==

Sidekick is a tool to help you create content more quickly. It hooks into OpenAI's GPT-3 text writing tool and gives you results based on the prompt that you enter. It's not only a convenient way to find ideas and inspiration for writing, it's also fun.

Because it uses your own API key, costs are low, and you pay only for what you use.

*Note*: At this time, Sidekick is only compatible with Gutenberg (the Block Editor) and not the Classic Editor.

== Features ==

* Enter a prompt and get a result!
* Choose a length of between 10 and 500 tokens
* Keep track of the last 10 items in your history

== Showcase ==

* Sidekick was used to create the text for all of the kittens on the [Kitten Delivery Service](https://www.kittendeliveryservice.com/) website.

== How to Use == 

1. Once the plugin is activated, go to Setting -> Sidekick
2. Add your OpenAI API key (there is a link that shows you where to get one)
3. Open up a post or page in the block editor and look for the Sidekick logo in the upper right
4. Start writing!
